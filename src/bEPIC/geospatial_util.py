    (1) transforms lon,lat to local Cartesian coordinate using (lon0,lat0) as origin

    Input: 
    (1) lon,lat [degree] MUST BE A NUMPY ARRAY
    (2) lon0,lat0 [degree] is used as the origin reference point
    (3) rot [degree] is the rotation angle form the old coord system (east is X+, north is y+)

        Counterclockwise rotation is positive
        Clockwise rotation is negative
